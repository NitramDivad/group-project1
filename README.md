## ** KidReads ** #

## ** First group project ** #

KidReads is an interactive e-reader desgined for children.

We designed this app with not just entertainment in mind, but education as well.

The idea for KidReads came from a group member whose daughter is in speech therapy. He wanted a way for her to learn to read while being able to practice words on her own.

The site presented is the "kids end", or where the parents direct their children on the KidReads webpage. Here we have the book choices displayed and a working example of a book being read.
